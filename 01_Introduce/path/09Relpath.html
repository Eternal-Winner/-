    When we need from a webpage of inside server  to another webpage,usually we use relpath
        All of relpath are beginning with . or .. 
            ./
            ../

        ./ can omit, and if not write ./ and ../ seem as wrote ./  .
        
        ./ present current profile directory
            - Here, cur page just is the 09.relpath.html
            - ./ just equaled with  directory of path with  09.Relpath.html (path)
