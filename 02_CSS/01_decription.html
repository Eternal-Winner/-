    <!-- (MethodII Inside style sheets)
    --Second method is encoding the style into head,
     and then select elements and setting the various style of tag by using CSS .
     It can setting many tag style,and when modifying just modify one.
     -Inside style sheets(ISS) are more convenient to repeat to use style.
     Problem:
        ISS only have an effect on cur page
            it style can't repeat using at across-page.

            color: green;
            font-size: 50px;
        }
    </style> -->

    <!-- 
    Method III(Outer style sheets (OSS)):
        -Encoding CSS style into an outside file
            then import the outside file by link tag.
        -The link tag need be used when using outside style.
            That mean the all WP which need use the style can quote it which
            enable style can using again and again.

        Behaviour(Javascript):
        CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) :
            In fact,webpage is a multilayer structure, using CSS could setting 
            format of any-layer for a page, but we only see top level of
            webpage.
        In short of ,CSS is used to setting format of WP.

    <!-- Using CSS modify format of element 
        Method I:
         --  By means of style attribute to setting formant of elements. 
         --Problem:
            Using inline-format only take effect for one, 
                If hope influencing more elements must to copy.
                and when the format occur changing,we must modify one by one
                that's very inconvenient.
            Notice:When developing never use inline style.
